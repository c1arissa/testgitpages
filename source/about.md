Hi, I'm Clarissa! I live in New York :statue_of_liberty: and :heart: :coffee: and :computer:'s!  Hah! No but really, on a serious note,

Blog to document my journey and interests in cybersecurity.  A compilation of projects and labs from my senior capstone course and some side projects and interests.  Here I write about things that are interesting to me and put whatever information people may want to know about me.

Information Security enthusiast looking for an entry level position in the field. Hard worker, Quick learner.

I joined the software field because it is what I enjoy doing. I know how to find information, analyze it, learn, unlearn, creatively re-apply and re-learn technology to build a product and to guide others.

 the below programs are a result of hard-work and self-study of API's and documentation.

My name is Clarissa Podell, and thank you for taking the time to check out my personal website.

You can call me a versatile creator. I'm known for quickly adopting new technologies and creating good quality working products with them. Apart from spending most of my life getting people to pronounce my name correctly, I also have a taste for fun, adventure and unprejudiced thought.

About Me
My name is Tobias Klein, and this is my personal website. I'm an expert in application security specializing in vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and reverse engineering. I'm also the co-founder and director of NESO Security Labs GmbH, a boutique information security consulting and research company.

About this blog
We live in the Digital Age, we grow up around computers, cameras, smartphones and other digital technologies. Nowadays computers are so small that they are embedded in our clothes, we carry them in our pockets or even wear them as jewelry. But all these devices are quite complex and most of us struggle to fully understand them and use them properly.

The question that now arises is: What about security and privacy ?

Well, this is the main topic of this blog, mostly on a technical standpoint. For 10 years now, I study the security around computers, networks and devices in order to bypass it. By creating this blog, I want to share, among other things, my projects, techniques, hacks and discoveries. Because Hacking is about Sharing, but it’s also about getting a better understanding of the technologies that we use every day.

About me
I’m just another hacker, working as a penetration tester. Over the past 10 years, I split my time between researching, consulting, and training students and security professional on a wide range of topics related to offensive security and computer networks.



Who am I? My name is Ruben Boonen (also known to some as b33f); security Zealot if such a term may be applied. There is no better feeling than popping a shell on a box, am I right or am I right.

I am a web developer focusing on front-end development. Always hungry to keep learning.

This is my new blog and my personal academic web site.

Hi, my name is Mike JS. Choi; JS is for Jun Soo. I am a college student & developer. Thanks for visiting my site.
I build things and write about software development when I have the time. Check out some of my projects and my blog posts!
I am also actively looking for an internship. Email me and I will be happy to send you my resume :D

While in school I realized the best way for me to learn something was to research how it works, write a tutorial that covers the main concepts, and then put it online for me to reference when needed.

About the site

I write aⱼni content in Markdown/kramdown, which is then converted via Jekyll into static HTML. The theme is based on Jekyll Clean Dark.

The site is uploaded via git to GitLab Pages, but is served up by Netlify since GitLab CI seems to be slowing down frowning. Netlify has automatic support for free SSL/TLS certificates from Let’s Encrypt, too!

### About This Website
Personal homepage based on [end2end]. Vitae is built with skeleton, powered by Jekyll and freely hosted in Github pages.

This site runs on Jekyll, a static-site generator written in Ruby.

Github Desktop - to sync files with your repository.
This site was made on an Apple MBP powered by Jekyll on Github Pages.

This website was built locally on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), an open source static site generator, and hosted in GitHub Pages.  I forked this theme from [end2end]() and used the Atom editor with GitHub integration / plugin on my desktop to customize the layout and add content.  Fonts are served through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (Lato and Raleway) and Icons through [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com) and [Octicons]().  This site is responsive and uses HTML and CSS written in Sass.  Favicon made by me and generated with [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net).  This website was built responsively using HTML5 and CSS in Sass.

This website was built responsively using HTML5, CSS and some jQuery magic. For the CMS, I'm currently using WordPress as the CMS, but am thinking of using Jekyll on my next build. Fonts are served through Google Fonts. For the photo grid, I'm using Masonry (Thanks David DeSandro), and for the lightbox, I decided to customize this jQuery plugin by Osvaldas Valutis. All photos on the website were taken by me.

CSS Wizardry is built on Jekyll, an open source static site generator. This is hosted using GitHub Pages.
The CSS is written in Sass, and built on top of inuitcss.
 GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free
