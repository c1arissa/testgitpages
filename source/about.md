Hi, I'm Clarissa and I live in New York.

{% comment %} While in school I realized the best way for me to learn something was to research how it works, write a tutorial that covers the main concepts, and then put it online for me to reference when needed. {% endcomment %}

### About This Website
This website is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), an open source static site generator, and hosted using GitHub Pages.  The theme was forked from [end2end]() with modifications made by me using the Atom editor with GitHub plugin on my desktop.  I used Atom editor with GitHub on my desktop to add and edit content.  Fonts are served through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and Icons through [Font Awesome]().  This site is responsive and uses HTML and CSS written in Sass.  Favicon generated with [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net).

This website was built responsively using HTML5, CSS and some jQuery magic. For the CMS, I'm currently using WordPress as the CMS, but am thinking of using Jekyll on my next build. Fonts are served through Google Fonts. For the photo grid, I'm using Masonry (Thanks David DeSandro), and for the lightbox, I decided to customize this jQuery plugin by Osvaldas Valutis. All photos on the website were taken by me.

CSS Wizardry is built on Jekyll, an open source static site generator. This is hosted using GitHub Pages.
The CSS is written in Sass, and built on top of inuitcss.
 GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free
