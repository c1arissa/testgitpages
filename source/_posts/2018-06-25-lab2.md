# Task: Factoring a 1024-bit RSA modulus
> This lab explores hash collisions and website certificates.
1. For hash collisions: contrary to dictionary attacks, where we are trying to ﬁnd M : H(M) = C, here given M, we are looking for M’ : H(M) = H(M’).
2. For website certificates: we want to challenge the security of a certificate. With a weak key we can attack the connection and decrypt network traffic.

## Description
> In this section we push the limits of computation and technique. 1024-bit RSA keys are still in common use, despite warnings to gradually upgrade to 2048-bit keys in the long run. Let’s see what can be done, given some special conditions.

> So you are sitting there, staring at this assignment to factor a 1024-bit RSA modulus. You have been struggling with or contemplating factoring a 512-bit integer, and now this? A friend of yours who has taken number theory swings by, looks at your computer screen, and you mumble something in frustration. He tells you something that sounds like "mind your own p's and q's," but you haven’t said anything wrong. Or was it that he said "mine your p's and q's?" Confused, yet intrigued, you start searching for an answer...

# Lab Setup and Requirements

Intrigued, you try to read the paper 'Mining Your Ps and Qs' and find the code that goes with it. You will need to find the right moduli to act as a database. Once you have found the moduli to work with, extract them, and place them one per line into the input file for the program.

The attack technique in fastgcd exploits keys that are poorly generated.  An attacker can compute the private key if she/he can find two distinct RSA moduli that share a common divisor.  The RSA moduli can be factored by finding the greatest common divisor (prime 1) as the first factor and then dividing the public moduli by the common divisor to find the second factor (prime 2).


The method for factoring 1024-bit RSA keys in this lab is based on the research in [Mining Your Ps and Qs: Detection of Widespread Weak Keys in Network Devices](https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.extended.pdf) by Nadia Heninger, Zakir Durumeric, Eric Wustrow and J. Alex Halderman at USENIX 2012.

This lab assignment uses the proof-of-concept tool `fastgcd.c` to factor a 1024-bit RSA modulus.

Found widespread vulnerabilities in embedded network devices - Factorable RSA keys (0.5% of TLS hosts; 0.03% of SSH)  
Routers, Firewalls, Switches, Server Management Cards, Cable Modems, Voice-­‐Over-­‐IP devices     

Research agenda: Collect keys, Look for specific vulnerabilities, Investigate causes. Collecting Public Keys using Nmap from EC2 on Port 443 (HTTPS) and Port 22 (SSH) which resulted in 6 million certificates.  Manually investigated hosts sharing keys. Vulnerable reasons for shared keys include entropy problems and default certificates and keys (Apache ships default certificates with installation). (5.6%) of TLS hosts and (9.6%) of SSH hosts.

Problems:
Repeated keys
Repeated factors in RSA keys

RSA keys:
Given that the Public key modulus N = pq and factoring N reveals the private key, the basic premise behind this method is that:

Factoring 1024­‐bit RSA not known to be feasible, BUT   
For N<sub>1</sub> = pq<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>=pq<sub>2</sub>
we can efficiently compute p = GCD(N<sub>1</sub>,N<sub>2</sub>)

Looking for Shared RSA Factors - All Pairs GCD (algorithm due to Bernstein)

## RSA Cryptography (requisite)

One of the requisites for this lab is knowledge of RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) cryptography.  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that uses asymmetric keys.  It's commonly used in network security applications for secure data transmission (and key exchange).  This is one of the first cryptosystems taught in Cybersecurity majors and is the foundation for more recent systems.

Before going forward, I'll briefly outline the RSA key generation algorithm.  I'll refer to this process later on in my solution.  If you're familiar with this computation then skip to the next section!  Feel free to [skip to the next section](#solution) if you're already familiar with this.

1. The algorithm requires two distinct prime integers $P$ and $Q$  (prime 1 and prime 2 respectively).  In practice, these numbers are chosen at "random" and verified using one of the primality test algorithms such as the Miller–Rabin test.
$$P = prime 1$$
$$Q = prime 2$$
Based on these numbers, the rest of the values in the algorithm can be calculated:
2. $$N = P \times Q$$
  * $N$ is used as the modulus for both the public and private keys. Its length, usually expressed in bits, is the key length.  In this post, I'll use $N$ and $Modulus$ interchangeably.
3. $$\phi(n) = (P-1) \times (Q-1)$$

4. $$E = $$  (this is part of the encryption key)

$$D = ed \mod 1$$ (this is part of the decryption key)

Some excellent sources I recommend on this subject for further reading include:
* [Applied Cryptography]()
* [Cryptography Engineering]()

The first part of this lab involves factoring an RSA modulus using the factorable technique.

A certificate bundle named `jjay.crt` was provided in the challenge directory which contained ten X.509 certificates with 1024-bit public keys.  
Simply reading the file through `cat jjay.crt` shows that it contains ten x.509 certificates ...

The program `fastgcd` requires an input database of moduli.  Since no other information or moduli were given, I decided to generate the input database by extracting the moduli from each of the ten X.509 public certificates.

OpenSSL only processes a single certificate at a time by default.  In the case of a certificate bundle or chain which contains multiple certificates in a single file, it will look at the first certificate, known as the root certificate, and ignore the rest.  So, the normal command to extract the modulus,
`openssl x509 -modulus -in jjay.crt`
will only look at the root certificate and ignore the rest.

For this reason, we can't use the normal OpenSSL command to extract the modulus out-of-the-box (i.e. `openssl x509 -modulus -in jjay.crt`).  After some research and good-ol-fashion trial-and-error, I found the following command forces OpenSSl to display information from all the certificates in the jjay chain:

I used the following command [1] to force OpenSSL to display information from all the certificates in the jjay chain:

```console
clarissa@ubuntu:other$ openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile jjay.crt | openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -text -noout | more
```

To generate the moduli database, I could either copy and paste the moduli from each certificate or find a way to automate the process of extracting the modulus from each certificate in the chain.

Next I needed to come up with an easy way to extract the moduli from each public certificate in the chain.   I did some research and eventually found a solution [2] I was able to adapt to my needs.

The following bash routine pipes the output of jjay.crt into awk which sends PEM encoded keys one at a time to the OpenSSL x509 command to extract the modulus.  This produces a list of the moduli for each certificate in the certificate chain.

hat is, piping a text file into a perl script. We could read the contents of the file by catting it through STDIN:

```console
clarissa@ubuntu:other$ cat jjay.crt | \
> awk 'BEGIN { x509 = "openssl x509 -noout -modulus" }
> /-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/ { a = "" }
> { a = a $0 RS }
> /-----END CERTIFICATE-----/ { print a | x509; close(x509) }'
```

I wrote the following short perl script that formats the two moduli in the lab description to match the above format with no commas or spaces.  It accepts multiple files on the command line (each contains the unformatted modulus) and writes the formatted moduli to a file `input`.

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl

open(my $out, ">",  "input") or die "Can't open file: $!";

while (<>) {
    # replace commas, newlines, and whitespaces with an empty string
    s/:|\s+//g;
    # output result in uppercase
    print $out uc($_);
}

print $out "\n";

close($out);
```

After the script runs, the moduli looks like the following:

```console
clarissa@ubuntu:other$ perl regex.pl mod1 mod2

```

The input database contains all but the root moduli from the `jjay.crt` bundle in addition to the two public moduli supplied in the lab description.  The final database contains 12 moduli.

I ran `fastgcd` by supplying the input file listing the collection of RSA moduli.  The program trace is displayed below:

`fastgcd` writes output to two files - `gcds` and `vulnerable_moduli` - when supplied with the right collection of RSA moduli.  As shown in the above program trace, 4 results were emitted meaning that weak keys were detected in my input.

Below are the contents of the `vulnerable_moduli` file.  This is a list of all keys in the database that share a common factor with another key.  At the top of the file we can see our two weak moduli from the public keys in the original 4.4.1 question.  This means that we can use this method to factor both moduli and compute the private key.

```console

The next output file lists the GCD’s, or common divisors, of each modulus listed in vulnerable_moduli.  The values in this file are the P’s (depending on which vulnerable moduli is chosen) and will be used to find the Q’s by dividing the common divisor P into the MODULUS (i.e. based on $N = P \times Q$).

In the next section, I will show how to use this information to reconstruct a private key to decrypt SSL traffic in Wireshark.


## 4.4.2 Decrypting SSL/TLS traffic
> Having successfully factored the RSA moduli, apply this newfound knowledge and move on to the next task, namely decrypting SSL/TLS traffic based on one of these two 1024-bit RSA private keys. Look inside the traffic to determine which private key is need, i.e. look for the public key matching one of the keys in the previous section. You may have to (re)construct the RSA private key from the two prime factors of the modulus and the given exponent by writing some code or manipulating the correct tools. Using WireShark and the guidelines from the lab file, decrypt the SSL/TLS traffic found in the file `ssldump.pcap`. The SSL/TLS traffic in question is on tcp port 44330, which you can narrow down using a filter in WireShark: `tcp port 44330`. There is no other relevant traffic in the pcap file, so the filter should not be necessary.

> Supply the prime factors of the RSA moduli and decrypted SSL/TLS traffic (the conversation should be 2671 bytes long), both in text form, as part of the report.

Using WireShark, load the private RSA key ssldump-key.pem into the proper screen under WireShark Preferences->Protocols->SSL, as shown here. Click on RSA keys list <Edit> to bring up the window 'SSL Decrypt':

Locate and load the pcap file sample-ssldump.pcap using File->Open. The packets inside the pcap become visible:

Click on a row, e.g. Client Key Exchange, as shown above. Click on Analyze->Follow->SSL Stream, and you get to see the contents of the SSL stream:

### Identify public key in the captured traffic

In this section, we need to determine which of the two private keys (given in the beginning) is needed to decrypt the traffic in the given `ssldump.pcap` file.

Before reconstructing the RSA private key, The first task is to identify the public key matching one of the 1024-bit RSA keys in the previous section.  Then we can reconstruct the corresponding private key.  I identified the necessary key by first extracting the public certificate from the traffic file `ssldump`.   With ssldump.pcap open in Wireshark, I found the public certificate inside the TLSv1 packet “Server Hello, Certificate, Server Hello Done” (circled below in red) and exported the bytes to a DER format file.

We were given two 1024-bit RSA private keys in the beginning.  In this section, we need to determine which of the two private keys (given in the beginning) is needed to decrypt the traffic in the given `ssldump.pcap` file.  We are told that only one of the two private keys given in the beginning will decrypt the pcap file.
I determined the necessary private key by first extracting the public certificate from the traffic file `ssldump`.   With ssldump.pcap open in Wireshark, I found the public certificate inside the TLSv1 packet “Server Hello, Certificate, Server Hello Done” (circled below in red) and exported the bytes to a DER file.

*I'll briefly describe how I extracted the DER file since this isn't widely documented online:*

With that packet selected in Wireshark, expand the protocol details for Secure Sockets Layer. The first certificate listed is the server's and the second is the client's.  Expand the client's certificate until the certificate bytes are exposed as in the below screenshot.  Right-click on certificate -> Export Packet Bytes -> Save as `public.der`.
keep expanding the protocol details under Secure Sockets Layer until you reach the client's certificate (it will be the second certificate listed after the server's certificate).  The correct line will display the certificate  bytes as shown below.  Next, with that line selected, right-click -> Export Packet Bytes -> Save As -> name the file "public.der".  Note that the der extension is not shown as a file extension option in the "Save as" window.  This is okay.  If you type `.der` after your file name, the format will be saved correctly.

It's very important that you select the correct line otherwise this method won't work.


<a href="/testgitpages/images/Extract-PubKey-ssldump.png">
![Extract PubKey](/testgitpages/images/Extract-PubKey-ssldump.png)
</a>

Now that I have a file containing the certificate in DER format named `public.der`, I can process the certificate with OpenSSL.

In a terminal I used OpenSSL to view the modulus of the X.509 certificate with the goal of identifying the public key.

```console
clarissa@ubuntu:other$ openssl x509 -inform DER -in public.der -noout -modulus
Modulus=D957AF3A155E15A81F9FFCEF85DEF8B9DC2DF8D0D4035D63FC6CEDA638E15007CAC3DD8D3F16F43A33A81A18928625EA1F9A629C1E6C4981748D6838155EE47A5F219EA45CD0480F2061586960CFAA08B4EF68EACEF6DD27F9233951DFAF73BC3B77F8483D520A01612F49A0DE94B31DD0F4A5AEFB65BA04DDF3F456D8645DD7
```

Comparing the above modulus to the two keys provided in the beginning description, we can confirm that we are dealing with the first key.  This is the $N$ value.

The above modulus matches the first key in the lab description.  This is our `N` value.

### (Re)construct the RSA Private-Key

After matching the public key in `ssldump.pcap` with one of the keys in the previous section, we can proceed with the RSA private-key (re)construction.

First, I ran the `fastgcd` program again but this time including only the above modulus plus the ten I extracted earlier from the jjay.crt bundle in 4.4.1.  Below are the contents of the resulting `gcd` output file.

```console
root@kali:fastgcd# cat gcds
f8108b1aa19f6b69e4a71102867d50ec6e21376dbf27fe110b653eec6a4463d45fb8d0ab2d0486657b12de6b398e9d54bf31b68d3da9b461c3911ed287afd519
f8108b1aa19f6b69e4a71102867d50ec6e21376dbf27fe110b653eec6a4463d45fb8d0ab2d0486657b12de6b398e9d54bf31b68d3da9b461c3911ed287afd519
```

Based on the paper “Mining Your Ps and Qs”, the above result is our $P$ value.  Finding the value of $Q$ is a matter of simple algebra and knowledge of RSA computation:

Since $N = P \times Q$, then

$Q = N / P$

Finding these values were much easier than expected.  The majority of my class did not get past this part in the lab.  The other half of the class asked me for some assistance.  I found that most students were overcomplicating this part when all that was required was a basic understanding how to calculate RSA keys based on two prime numbers P and Q.

**The two prime factors of the RSA modulus are:**

Although we successfully factored the RSA modulus, we are unable to do anything with the data in this format.  We'll have to populate the data into the proper RSA private-key format so we can use it to decrypt the traffic in the pcap file.

In order to decrypt the SSL traffic in Wireshark
Next I created the private key certificate needed to decrypt the SSL traffic in Wireshark.  

I used the script [rsatool.py](https://github.com/ius/rsatool/blob/master/rsatool.py) that calculates the private key d and then populates the various components that constitute a private RSA key structure.  The script accepts two integers as input (p, q) and has an option to return parameters as a Wireshark compatible PEM encoded RSA private key.

I ran the script supplying the two primes I found above with the option to write PEM output to privkey.pem:

```console

RSA key ok
```

Now, we have our PEM encoded RSA private key that we can use in Wireshark.

### Decrypt SSL/TLS Traffic

First, we need to configure Wireshark with our private key.  This can be done in the GUI by going to Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> SSL -> "Edit" next to RSA keys list.  A new window named "SSL Decrypt" appears and we can add our key by creating a new entry.  After successfully adding the key and setting parameters for IP, port, and protocol, it should look something like the below screen:

I configured Wireshark’s SSL preferences with my private RSA key “privkey.pem”

</a>

It’s *finally* time to decrypt the SSL traffic.  After configuring my private RSA key “privkey.pem”, I opened the capture file in Wireshark (File -> Open -> `ssldump.pcap`).  Below is a screenshot of the decrypted traffic.  Packets with application data in lines no. 17 and 19 are now available to view including an HTTP GET request which was marked as “Application Data” prior to decrypting.

### Decrypted SSL/TLS Conversation

I obtained the following decrypted conversation in Wireshark by using Analyze -> Follow -> SSL Stream:

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Decrypted-SSL-Traffic-1.png">

</a>

It's also possible to view the decrypted SSL/TLS conversation in text form by saving the SSL stream to a file.
