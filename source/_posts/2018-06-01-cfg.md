## Introduction
Exploit development and exploit mitigation techniques are among my favorite topics in cybersecurity.  I first came across exploit mitigations while playing online wargames.  At first, like many others I’m sure, I found these defenses frustrating as my normal late 90’s-style techniques failed.  However, after learning about more advanced exploitation techniques, I have now come to appreciate exploit mitigations and equally appreciate the techniques to bypass them.  The ingenuity and sophistication of exploits that outsmart defenses is fascinating.  What’s more, I find the techniques to bypass these defenses exhilarating – the ingenuity of outsmarting defenses developed by the efforts of very intelligent defense teams.

So, when it came time to select a topic for our Capstone research project, I convinced my team of 3 other students to agree with the topic of Bypassing Control Flow Integrity.  We chose to focus on Microsoft’s CFI implementation called Control-Flow Guard (CFG) mostly because of its popularity and relevancy to the current security landscape.

In this post, I will provide a brief summary of CFG internals that I [accumulated/compiled during my research] learned during this research.  This is similar to a cheatsheet that I used during my research.  
Most of this information was acquired while working on a research project exploring techniques to bypass CFG.  

A better defensive approach would keep a program’s control-flow from being hijacked in the first place.  Control-flow integrity systems provably accomplish this, at a runtime overhead that is likely acceptable for many applications, and ought to see wider adoption.

## Control-Flow Integrity (CFI)

Abadi et al. introduced control-flow integrity (CFI) [4] as a method of preventing attacks by restricting jump,  call,  and return instructions to follow the statically-determined control-flow graph of the program.  Due to the difficulty of obtaining a precise
control-flow graph of the program, many defenses choose instead to enforce a less precise policy. Often, this policy simply requires that returns be call-preceded, and indirect calls point to the beginning of functions [34, 6, 32].

Introduced in the 2005 seminal paper by Abadi et. al [[1]](https://www.example.com), Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) is an exploit mitigation that combats a class of exploit techniques known as control-flow hijack attacks.  These attacks leverage memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or type confusions which may allow an attacker to change the code a program executes, or to execute parts of the program out of order. in programs written using unsafe languages such as C or C++ to alter the intended flow of code.  and redirect normal program execution to an attacker-controlled area.  Typically, the goal is to execute arbitrary instructions with the same privileges as the program.  

Memory corruption errors in C/C++ programs remain the most common source of security vulnerabilities in today’s systems.  Control-flow hijacking attacks exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities to divert program execution away from the intended control flow.
The goal of Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) [Abadi et al is to restrict the set of possible control-flow transfers to those that are strictly required for correct program execution. This prevents code-reuse techniques such as ROP from working because they would cause the program to execute
control-flow transfers which are illegal under CFI. Conceptually, most CFI mechanisms follow a two-phase process. An analysis phase constructs the Control-Flow Graph (CFG) which approximates the set of legitimate control-flow transfers. This CFG is then used at runtime by an enforcement component to ensure that all executed branches correspond to edges in the CFG

 By exploiting such flaws, the attacks can subvert execution and gain control over software behavior. For instance, a buffer overflow in an application may result in a call to a sensitive system function, possibly a function that the application was never intended to use.

 mitigations are usually of limited scope, and attackers have found ways to circumvent each deployed mitigation mechanism.

CFI enforcement is effective against a wide range of common attacks, since abnormal control-flow modification is an essential step in many exploits—independently of whether buffer  overflows  and  other  vulnerabilities  are  being  exploited.  We have examined many concrete attacks and found that CFI enforcement prevents most of them.  These include both classic, stack-based buffer-overflow attacks and newer, heap-based “jump-to-libc” attacks.  

CFI requires that, during program execution, whenever a machine-code instruction transfers control, it targets a valid destination, as determined by a CFG created ahead of time.
CFI may be enforced by dynamic checks that compare the target address of each computed control-flow transfer to a set of allowed destination addresses.



CFI limits program execution to valid traces only based on a control-flow graph of the programmer’s intended design that is determined by the compiler at compile time.  Enforcement is provided at run-time to validate control-flow transfers.  So, even in the presence of a memory-corruption bug, this makes it more difficult for attackers to redirect execution.  Researchers have found it difficult to implement CFI because lack of widespread adoption and concerns varying from additional overhead and computing costs, compatibility issues, and the difficulty of creating an accurate Control-Flow Graph.  Only recently have we seen widespread adoption with the deployment of production-ready technologies in late 2014 from Microsoft and LLVM/Clang.

## Control-Flow Guard Internals

New load config structure adds 5 new fields
Including key data for CFG which is generated in build processing
- CFG check function pointer(point to null subroutine)
- CFG function table(used by NT kernel)
- CFG flags

Call Target Validation Logics
LdrpValidateUserCallTarget
It only executes 10 instructions in most cases
It will check whether Eip is the instruction inside LdrpValidateUserCallTarget

Add CFG Exception:
CFG allows user process to add some exceptions for compatibility
Kernelbase!SetProcessValidCallTargets  
It will call NtSetInformationVirtualMemory-> MiCfgMarkValidEntries to add valid call bits into bitmap

Control-Flow Guard (CFG or Guard) is Microsoft's implementation of Control-Flow Integrity.  It's a compiler-based mitigation in Visual Studio C++ versions 2015 Update 3 and newer and runs in Windows versions 8.1 and 10.   
It's a compiler-based security mechanism that combats exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities commonly found in programs written in unsafe programming languages such as C and C++.  Extra runtime security checks can detect attempts to alter the intended flow of code, known as a control-flow hijack attack.  Makes it much harder for exploits to execute arbitrary code through memory corruption vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.
A combination of compile and run-time support from CFG implements control flow integrity that tightly restricts where indirect call instructions can execute.

Exception handlers are now registered in the Load Configuration Directory, and before an Exception Handler is executed, its address is checked against the list of registered handlers. We’ll talk about how to bypass this later on in this article.

Here's an example C program, in a file called test.c, with an indirect call in `foo()` to function `bar()`.

{% highlight c linenos %}
//**  test.c  **//
#include <stdio.h>

void bar() {
	printf("Inside indirect call bar()\n");
}

void foo() {
	void (*fptr)() = &bar;
	(*fptr)();  /* indirect call */
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	foo();
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

CFGuard inserts extra runtime security checks which can detect attempts to alter the intended flow of code.  The implementation of these checks can seen in the assembly of compiled code.  But first, here's what the assembly of the compiled code looks like WITHOUT CFGuard enabled in IDA Pro.

### Enabling CFG

MSVC’s `/guard:cf` switch enables compiler generation of Control Flow Guard security checks.  When enabled, the compiler analyzes control flow for valid indirect call targets at compile time, and then inserts code to verify the targets at runtime [1][1]. The valid call sites identified by the compiler are stored in extra structures in the headers of your binaries and used at runtime to validate destination locations of indirect calls.

Code can be compiled in the Visual Studio IDE or command prompt.  My personal preference is the latter however.  In a Visual Studio command prompt (usually comes installed with the Visual Studio IDE), the following command passes the `/guard:cf` option to the compiler / linker program `cl.exe` to enable CFG protection in our source code file `test-cfg.c`.

`C:\test> cl /Zi /guard:cf test-cfg.c`

(The flag `/Zi` enables debugging information).
